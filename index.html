  <p align="center"> 
    Celestial Rapture is an action adventure game where the player controls a
    hero conflicted with one task: uncover the dirty past of their parents. Set 
    within a new solar system consumed with the same greed and corrupt thoughts
    that destroyed the Milky Way galaxy, the player may choose to support the 
    government or the rebels. Fighting to piece together your parent’s past while 
    supporting your shop proves difficult yet not unmanageable. This narrative
    should not suggest a clear path to choose but rather emulate a set of moral dilemmas for the 
    player to solve. The player’s decisions should clearly affect the world.
